              <p>Finding a cab, especially during peak travel times or in less-traveled areas, can be an incredibly frustrating task. But car services are often much more expensive than the average cab ride. Enter UberCab, a new service that offers an on-demand car service via an iPhone app or SMS.

After signing up for an UberCab account and downloading the free iPhone app,  you can then set your location and request a car service from the application.  The app will determine your location and you can set your exact pickup location. UberCab will then send your request to their network of drivers who happen to be in the area.</p>

              <p>I got light of a new service called Ubercab from my friend Matt Hunter a few weeks ago, and I finally tried it out today.The service is way simpler than flagging down a regular taxicab, and only a small percentage more expensive.</p>

              <p>If you live in a major U.S. city, you've probably taken your share of cabs. When it's raining, or when the nearest subway stop is a tad too far, cabs are a great resource. But even better than the cab is the car service -- elegant and clean and not much more expensive than a run-of-the-mill taxi. Only problem is, you usually need to set an appointment for...</p>

              <p>Did Ubercab just crash and burn? Taxi and limo industry insiders in California today informed TechCrunch that the San Francisco Metro Transit Authority & the Public Utilities Commission of California have ordered the startup to cease and desist.

UPDATE: Since the orders arrived on October 20th, Ubercab has remained in service under threat of penalties including up to $5,000 fee per instance of Ubercab’s operation, and potentially 90 days in jail per each day the company remains in operation past the orders.

The company's brand name and logo appear to be in metamorphosis; on its website and blog, Ubercab's logo now reads simply "Uber," and the company commented to its own Facebook community yesterday afternoon, "more uber than cab."</p>
