              <p>For the past several weeks, there have been quite a few whispers around the web about a new service called Burbn. Besides having a great name, the service is apparently in a very hot space right now: location-based services. I say "apparently," because the service is still very much a stealth project. But it's not so stealth that they can't get a seed round of funding.

Burbn has just closed a $500,000 seed round, we're hearing. According to sources, both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz participated in the round. From what we can tell, right now, Burbn is just a one-man shop: Kevin Systrom, a former Googler. With the funding, you can probably expect that to change soon.</p>

              <p class="lead"> Distilled From Burbn, Instagram Makes Quick Beautiful Photos Social (Preview) – TechCrunch</p>
              <p>For about the past six months or so, I've been using an app called Burbn. Despite being in stealth mode, the app attracted quite a bit of buzz as it was in the location space and built entirely in HTML5. Oh, and the $500,000 investment from  Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz helped gather interest as well. But it turns out Burbn was a red herring of sorts. Or perhaps more appropriately, it was a testing ground. The product that emerged is much better: Instagram.

Unlike Burbn, Instagram is neither a location-based app (though that is one component), nor is it HTML5-based. But it did spring out of the way co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger saw people using Burbn. That is: quick, social sharing -- and a desire to share photos from places. That's the foundation of Instagram.</p>
